wordscore_game is a simple game that loads a number of letters to resemble the 'hand' dealt to the player.
The player is then guided throughout the game to enter valid words, checked against an external file, and each valid word is tallied up according to a scoring system.
The game ends when the player is unable to create any more valid words given the remaining letters.
Enjoy!!!
